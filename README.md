## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing I learned is how to use Tailwind CSS in layout. I used the flexbox utility to lay out the mobile and screen view. I also used the rounded corners so that they would switch sides from mobile to screen view. Once I figured out where those utility classes were, I was surprised at how much faster and easier my layout got. I realize that this is a simple project, but I hope to use this knowledge to develop more complecated layouts in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This was my main resource for installing Tailwind CSS and lookiong up utility classes.
